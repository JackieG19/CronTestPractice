Following the Cron lesson lets put what you created into practice:

Create a new api route named practice "/api/practice"

this route should have the following routes:
GET '/' some sort of simple json to show this api endpoint exists.
GET '/start/:num' this should start the barkWorker
GET '/stop' this should stop the barkWorker
Post '/sort' this should accept an array of names. 

It should send it sortWorker who will then output a sorted version of the array to the console. 
The route should inform the user that the action was started.

create two workers:
barkWorker.js - this should have a function that creates the barkWorker with the num being used as the second iterator. 
IE if the route is /start/5 the barkWorker should "bark" to the console every 5 seconds /start/10 then bark every 10 seconds.

The trick here is the scope of the bark worker. 
Give it a variable similar to adderWorker but also need to be able to stop it from a different route and not a one time function.

sortWorker.js - this is a one time worker that accepts an array of names and then sorts them. 

Creating your own sorting system earns bonus points rather then using a built in sorting method.


Extra Credit - Asynchronous Cron

Figure out a way to have the server run the adder/1000000000 process without locking up the site.
